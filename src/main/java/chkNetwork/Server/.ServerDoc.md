<h1>Server Documentation</h1>

Classes:

**CheckerNetworkService**

This class is the main system for running the game.
it keeps track of its own authentication board. (to make sure there is truth on the server)

When a client pushes any sort of move or whatnot, it will be sent to the server to make sure that it all works.

It also keeps track of player roles, so that when a command is sent by a player who shouldnt be
sending that command, it can say that it is not a correct message.

**ClientHandlerThread**

This class is the class that listens to the individual clients (as defined in ClientMode.java)
When it gets a message, it generally just sees what the message was, what information is
associated with the message, and then it handles anything that needs to be done with
that information.
