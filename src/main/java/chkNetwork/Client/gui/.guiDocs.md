<h1>
Gui Documentation
</h1>


In the GUI package, there is 2 pages, and 1 component class.

**CheckersGameGUI**

this here holds the GUI, it pretty much just serves as a means to tell
the client to send a move message.

Now supposedly the server is supposed to handle deciding if a move is complete or not.
But that did not have enough time to be fully implemented.

**JBoardCellButton**

This class is meant to be used alongside the CheckersGame GUi.
each button holds a position value, which makes it easy to send
commands to the server.

**LobbyWindow**

The LobbyWindow class is the first thing the user sees when they log in.
It is pretty simple.
it is meant to tell the server when to start the game.

An issue with it unfortunately is that it doesnt actually swap roles in the expected way.
so Pressing on "Assign Role" does not actually do anything as of now. (4:14 pm)
