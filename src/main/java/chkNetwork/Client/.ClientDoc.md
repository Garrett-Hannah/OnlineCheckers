<h1>Client Documentation</h1>

**Application Controller**

This class helps bring together a lot of the functions
in things like the clientModel, and the GameModel
It helps tell which clientModel Functions To Fire
as well as a few other important things like how the application
plays out from beginning to end. The controller is a bit messy because
it contains a lot of bidirectional functionality between the
Event Listener and the GUI.

**ClientEventListener**
This class is primarily used by the ApplicationController Class
What it does is kind of make an automated way to handle Server Responses.
What the client does is fire off functions from the ClientEventListener.
And depending on what had been implemented, it will kind of just do that.

**ClientModel**
This is the actual theory behind the other two classes.
This class takes in responses from the server.

It then can decide to do certain things based on the right criteria.
Things like send messages to the server.

It constantly maintains the connection between it and the server,
so it should be expected that will work well.

**ClientRequest**

This is a simple data object. all it stores is a request Code and
then the payload.

That makes it pretty simple. It could be made a bit better by strongly defning the payload
as certain values. (IE making a positionPayload that holds 2 and only 2 Positions)
